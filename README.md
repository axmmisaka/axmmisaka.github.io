## Who I am
  You may see my profile [here](https://github.com/axmmisaka). Of course you won't find something useful, but you can just find within 2100+ people if you wanna find me.
  Unfortunately, that's *almost* everything I want to tell you about who I am.
  I say almost because there's still *something*:
  Steam: [AXM_MISAKA20001](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078845210/home/)
  Keybase: [axmmisaka](https://keybase.io/axmmisaka)

## Contact Information
Top 2 methods will have 90% guarantee you to reach me within 1 week, as long as I am still free (e.g. military training will make me unable to receive these stuff) and can access the Internet (phone is confiscated by teacher).
### Keybase
  Use Keybase to message me if you want to. Now I do open keybase everyday, but... Well, maybe I won't when you want to contact me.
### E-mail
  Go to a OpenPGP key server (like [this](https://pgp.mit.edu/)) and search key 0x48900cf37a846f72. This is my public key, which contains my E-mail. Remember to encrypt using this key, otherwise you may not receive a reply.
### QQ, Phone, Wechat, address, cable address, etc...
  Sorry but I will not share these important information publicly. Of course if you search axmmisaka on Google it may appear, I haven't tried that yet. However, if you think it is necessary to know any of these stuff, please let me know by other contact methods.
### Baidu Tieba
  I don't use it anymore. Just google it and you'll find out.
### Bilibili
  Still, google it and you'll find out. I will respond once I see it - even if it's sent to me 1 year ago!
### Steam/Origin/Uplay
  Origin/Uplay: AXM_MISAKA20001.  
  You might want to contact something related to games with me on that. Do keep in mind that I seldom play games anymore. I even hardly ever play KanColle!
### GitHub
  OK - submit an issue in repo of this website (please, only this), and GitHub will send a E-mail to me. If you only want to chat something to me, that might be the best idea.
### Amateur radio call sign
  Unfortunately, while I do have an operator's license, I cannot get a callsign due to age limitation. If you're a HAM and wants to CQ me, contact me first.
  I only have a UHF radio so it's not a good idea to contact me using this method if you cannot go to my workplace in 1 hour with car.
