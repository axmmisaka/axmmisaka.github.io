## Who I am
  You may see my profile [here](https://github.com/axmmisaka). Of course you won't find something useful, but you can just find within 2100+ people if you wanna find me.
  Unfortunately, that's *almost* everything I want to tell you about who I am.
  I say almost because there's still *something*:
  Keybase: [axmmisaka](https://keybase.io/axmmisaka)

## Contact Information
Top 2 methods will have 90% guarantee you to reach me within 1 week, as long as I am still free (e.g. military training will make me unable to receive these stuff) and can access the Internet (phone may be confiscated by teacher).  
This section used to have a lot information, but I deleted them - some of them are useless. If you want to read it, just find github history.
### Keybase
  Use Keybase to message me if you want to. Now I do open keybase everyday, but... Well, maybe I won't when you want to contact me.
### E-mail
  Go to a OpenPGP key server (like [this](https://pgp.mit.edu/)) and search key 0x48900cf37a846f72. This is my public key, which contains my E-mail. Remember to encrypt using this key, otherwise you may not receive a reply.
### QQ, Phone, Wechat, address, cable address, etc...
  Sorry but I will not share these important information publicly. Of course if you search axmmisaka on Google it may appear, I haven't tried that yet. However, if you think it is necessary to know any of these stuff, please let me know by other contact methods.
### Steam/Origin and other stuff
