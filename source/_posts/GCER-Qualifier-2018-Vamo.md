GCER Chinese National Qualifier is held in Dalian, Liaoning 19-20 May 2018.

Our team(which, for some security reasons, will not be disclosed) has got a prize that is enough for us to go to GCER! Vamo!

Two of my papers successfully entered conference proceedings, which is very nice. I also did presentations for them. They are all available [here](https://github.com/axmmisaka/GCER2018China_proceedings).

Anyway, our team and our school did a great job(not very good in matches though, and not enough luck). Wish we got a better prize on GCER!
