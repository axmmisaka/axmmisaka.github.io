My teacher and instructor in football referee, Mr.Tang, left the world of myocardial infarction.

He was performing fitness test for referees in China League One(Serie A) with Chinese Football Association. He lost his consciousness during the interval test, and passed away at hospital in the next heartbroken early morning at the age of 35.

He was the instructor of all active referees registered after 2010 in our local football association. He also did all the human resource work for the association week by week for the entire 8 years while still being a National Referee and refereeing the top league of China - Chinese Super League.

The message was sudden. We can do nothing but improve ourselves while carrying his dream to be the referee in the World Cup Final. 

Rest in peace, my teacher;
Requiesce in pace, mi magister.



我足球裁判的老师和引路人，唐老师，因心肌梗塞离开了人世。

他当时在与中国足协进行中甲联赛裁判体能测试。他在间歇跑中失去了意识，并在第二天令人心碎的凌晨离开了人世，享年35岁。

他是我们当地足球协会所有2010年后注册的目前当执裁判的导师。他还在近8年间周周为当地足协做所有的人事工作，与此同时作为国家级裁判在中国的顶级联赛——中国足球超级联赛中执法。

消息来的很突然。我们除了带着他在世界杯决赛的赛场上执法的梦想努力提升自己以外，什么都做不了了。

安息吧，我的老师。
